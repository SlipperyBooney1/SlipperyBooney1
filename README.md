A quote for you:

"When you fail, thats part of succuess in life, no one should and or shall expect you to get
all A's in school, your grades don't define who you really are. All you should do in school and outside of school
is try your best, don't be other people, be yourself. When life throws a brick at you, you got to get back up and move on.
Love yourself, love your family, accpet people for who they are. One thing I know and will never forget is that every time you chat with a friend, best friend or family member, whoever it is, that could be the last time you chat with them forever. Love them unconditnally, no matter if they are Trans, Bi, Gay, Lesbian etc. **Choose your friends wisley** 
Your vote matters. Follow your dreams, live life, life is too short, live it to its fullest. Some days will be bad, others will be good."

My brother's friend once told me "Give people a chance, they could be doing what they are doing for attention because something trumatic happened in their life" 


Let people belive what they want to belive..

8 Billion people on this earth, you are one of them.

If you belive in god, here's a quote "The reason why bad things happen to you is that god has done that for better things to come into your life, theres never no reason bad things happen."
