A quote for you:

"When you fail, thats part of succuess in life, no one should and or shall expect you to get
all A's in school, your grades don't define who you really are. All you should do in school and outside of school
is try your best, don't be other people, be yourself. When life throws a brick at you, you got to get back up and move on.
Love yourself, love your family, accpet people for who they are. One thing I know and will never forget is that every time you chat with a friend, best friend or family member, whoever it is, that could be the last time you chat with them forever. Love them unconditnally, no matter if they are Trans, Bi, Gay, Lesbian etc. **Choose your friends wisley**"
